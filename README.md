**1.** Since *Client A* and *Client B* are on the same private network, their IP address must represent the same network in accordance to the subnet mask.
<br>
The subnet mask is *255.255.255.0*, which means that the first 3 bytes of the IP address represent the network, and the 4th byte represents the host. Since we are on the same network, only the host can change. 
<br>
The solution will be anything in the range of **104.96.23.0 - 104.96.23.255** excluding the following 3:
* **104.96.23.0:** The first number in the range of hosts (0 in this case) represents the network and cannot be used by a host.
* **104.96.23.255:** The last number in the range of hosts (255 in this case) represents the broadcast address.
* **104.96.23.12:** This address is already used by the host *Client B*.

**2.** Same reasoning as *1.*, however the subnet mask is *255.255.0.0* in this case. The first 2 bytes of the IP address will represent the network; and the last 2 bytes, the host address.
<br>
The solution will be anything in the range of **211.191.0.0 - 211.191.255.255**, excluding:
* **211.191.0.0:** Represents the network address.
* **211.191.255.255:** Represents the broadcast address.
* **211.191.89.75:** Already taken by host *Client C*.

**1.** Since *Client B* is on the same private network as *Client A*, they should have the exact same subnet mask.
<br>
The solution can only be **255.255.255.224**.

![#ff0000](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff0000/000000?text=+)
**2.** To understand the subnet mask of *255.255.255.224*, let's look at it in binary form, along with the IP *192.168.20.222* of *Client B*:

<center>

```
MASK: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000
IP:   11000000.10101000.00010100.11011101
```
</center>
As we can see, the first 27 bits represent the IP address, while only the last 5 bits represent the host address.
<br>
All these 27 bits representing the network must stay the same in the IP addresses of hosts on the same network. To get the answer, we can only change the last 5 bits.
<br>
<br>
The answer is in the range of:

```
BIN:  11000000.10101000.00010100.11000000 - 11000000.10101000.00010100.11011111
or
DEC:  192.168.20.192 - 192.168.20.223
```
Excluding:
<br>
* **11000000.10101000.00010100.11000000:** Represents the network address (notice all 0 in the last 5 bits).
* **11000000.10101000.00010100.11011111:** Represents the broadcast address (notice all 1 in the last 5 bits).
* **11000000.10101000.00010100.11011110:** *Client B* already has that address.

**3.** Here we are introduced to the slash "/" notation for the subnet mask on *Interface D1*. A subnet mask of */30* means that the first 30 bits of the IP address represent the network address, and the remaining 2 bits represent the host address:
<center>

```
Mask /30: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100
```
</center>

We can see that this binary number corresponds to the decimal *255.255.255.252*, therefore it is identical to the mask found on *Interface C1*.
<br>
The answers can then be any addresses, as long as they meet the following conditions:
* The network address (first 30 bits) must be identical for *Client D* and *Client C*.
* The host bits (last 2 bits) cannot be all 1, nor all 0.
* *Client D* and *Client C* do not have identical IP addresses.
